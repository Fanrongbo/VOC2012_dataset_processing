# VOC2012_dataset_processing
I persent some python program  about VOC2012/2007 datasets using and processing mehod.<br>
The processing program include:<br>
   1.Select special category from VOC2012/2007 dataset.<br>
   2.Create val.txt and train.txt for training model.<br>
   3.If annotate the datasets by youself, you could test whether the label file (.xml) is correct to the orignial image.<br>
   4.If the file name of annotations and images are out of order,you could re-sort and name the dataset files.<br>
   5.In order to enhance the robust of training model, expanding and enhancing the datasets is a good idea.There is a enhancing datasets program include mirroring,rotation,brightness.<br>
